<h1><u>Foxconn - A Manufacturing Giant</u></h1>
<div>
<p>Hon Hai Precision Industry better known as Foxconn technology group, is the world's largest multinational electronics manufacturer founded by Terry Gou in 1974 in Taiwan. From a small TV component manufacturer, Foxconn has grown to manufacture 40% of all consumer electronics produced globally. I chose to investigate Foxconn's growth over the past 40 years, and how it has contributed to the era of high-quality, low-cost technology. In this research paper, I discuss how Foxconn has been innovative and the effects that valuable business networks, favourable state policies, and a favourable labour pool have had on Foxconn's exponential growth.

<h2>Foxconn's innovation</h2>
<p>Foxconn has been innovative in produce high-volume, high-quality electronics components while reducing production costs. This innovation is seen in Foxconn's revenue which has steadily risen over the past two decades <em>(Figure 1 below)</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>The graph shows a steady rise in Foxconn's revenue from 0.71 billion to 5.34 billion USD between 2005 and 2019. During the time, Foxconn grew to employ a million labourers in China. Another sign of Foxconn's growth is its market share of 31.9% in 2014, which is significantly higher than its next best competitor, Pegatron, with just 7.0%. This shows the innovative nature of Foxconn with respect to its competitors in one of the most competitive industries.</p>
<h2>Foxconn's accessibility to valuable business networks</h2>
<p>The knowledge Foxconn received in its early stages was essential for its development over the years. This is exemplified in Foxconn's contract with IBM. In the early 1980s, Terry Gou visited IBM's research center in Raleigh North Carolina to personally educate IBM on Foxconn's plants. He managed to acquire an order for PC connectors. This was a major step as the production of IBM's first PC that same year helped boost Foxconn's growth. This allowed Foxconn to amass orders from US multinational companies (MNCs) including Texas Instruments (TI), Dell and Philips. By learning from the heads of Taiwanese branches of these MNCs, Terry Gou adopted the 5S management system and the Just In Time (JIT) production model. He also adopted Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software from US firms to increase manufacturing efficiency. Through interactions with business networks and its headquarters in Taiwan, Foxconn was able to make use of knowledge spillovers to increase efficiency and innovation in production.</p>

<p>The effect of valuable business networks in Foxconn's growth is also demonstrated in its production of PC chassis. To fill PC chassis orders from Compaq, Foxconn contracted local Taiwanese firms. By working closely with these firms, Terry Gou learned of the manufacturing processes and techniques in chassis production. With the acquired knowledge, Terry Gou replicated these production lines in his Shenzhen factory in China. In 1987, Terry Gou spent 287,000 USD to train his employees abroad. This allowed them to gain tacit knowledge, a sticky type of knowledge that can only be learnt through physical interactions between entities. Foxconn made use of its location in Taiwan to gain access to valuable tacit knowledge through partnerships with local businesses. This helped Foxconn reduce production costs, expand production into China, and gain the trust of one of the world's largest PC manufacturers at the time. Additionally, by training employees on-site, Foxconn was able to take advantage of valuable knowledge spillovers to further innovate.</p>

<h2>Foxconn's access to favourable state policies</h2>

<p>Both the central and regional Chinese governments have provided Foxconn with favourable policies that helped it innovate. While Foxconn was started in Taiwan, it moved production to Shenzhen, China in 1988. This was under the coastal development program implemented by the Central government. Strategies implemented include opening up Special Economic Zones <em>(SEZs)</em> like Shenzhen, improving infrastructure, providing land to build factories, relaxing labour migration laws and cutting taxes by up to 50% in SEZs. Additionally, be reducing tariffs from over 50% to 15%, the Chinese government incentivised Foreign Direct Investment <em>(FDI)</em>, providing Chinese manufacturers with access to capital. With these first-mover benefits, Foxconn set up a factory in Shenzhen in 1988, hiring 150 migrant workers. Over time, as Foxconn grew, this Shenzhen campus has grown into a city with 400,000 Foxconn employees. </p>

<p>The decentralized nature of China's governing structure has encouraged local governments to compete with one another for FDI. They encouraged investment through offering an abundant supply of cheap labour to foreign firms, building up strong infrastructure and reducing government controls on foreign investment. During the 1990s, these preferential policies were provided by the Shanghai and Kunshan local governments who incentivised Foxconn to set up factories in their regions. With investment accounting for two-thirds of productivity growth and with geography acting as a platform for organising innovative activity, this access to capital helped Foxconn innovate. In 2012, Foxconn employed over 3,000 workers in its Kunshan factories, while it built headquarters in Shanghai. As Foxconn grew, its employment and growth increased the GDP of its regions. This led to the scale effect, wherein regions received more FDI due to increased confidence of investors resulting from higher regional GDP. Other local governments, hence, encouraged Foxconn to relocate to their regions by recruiting workers for them, providing land for factories, and exempting them from high taxes.</p>

</div>

<p>As local governments provided Foxconn with access to capital, a favourable labour pool, and infrastructure, it diversified its manufacturing plants throughout China. The effects of this are seen in Figure 2. Both the central and regional governments have provided Foxconn with the resources to set up factories, expand production, and keep costs low. These factors have promoted Foxconn's innovation and growth <em>(Figure 1).</em></p>

<p>While Foxconn started off with a factory in Shenzhen on the East coast, the Chinese government's Go West policy has further helped Foxconn spread out throughout China. China's development was unequally spread, with coastal regions experiencing thrice the GDP per capita in 1978. This led the government to implement the Go West strategy in 1996 to encourage investment and development into Western China. The policy was aimed at developing technological businesses and improving the investment environment in the West. The government incentivised foreign investment by offering tax privileges to those who invested. Additionally, the government increased public investment into education, energy supply, power generation and infrastructure including roads and railway lines. As stated by Feldman and Kogler, local universities are necessary for innovation. Infrastructure is a key element to economic growth and increases the rate at which knowledge exchanges take place. With improved transportation production costs are decreased. Additionally, places are better connected and engage more with each other, increasing the chances of knowledge spillovers. This provided Western regions with key factors of innovation and economic growth. These factors aided local governments such as the Wuhan, Chengdu and Zhengzhou governments in convincing companies to locate factories in their regions. All three regions have built high technology parks since. Foxconn opened factories in these regions in 2010 and shifted 20% of its production toward the West. The Go West policy aided Foxconn in gaining easier access to capital and infrastructure. These key components have allowed Foxconn to open up production plants in the West of China and reduce production costs to further innovate.</p>

<h2>Foxconn's access to a favourable labour pool</h2>

<p>oxconn has managed to innovate over the past decades due to its access to a favourable labour pool. In China, Foxconn has access to over 1 million low skilled workers with low pay and is the country's largest private employer. Due to this, Foxconn is able to keep its production costs low while maintaining a high volume of production. Both the local and central Chinese governments have allowed for these favourable circumstances by providing first-mover benefits and relaxed migration regulations. Local governments have encouraged Foxconn to set up factories in their regions by providing low wage workers and setting up recruitment programs. As stated by Crescenzi, high incomes are increasingly metropolitan in emerging and developed countries. The promise of high wages has encouraged internal migrant workers to move to large cities. This has provided Foxconn with access to low-cost workers. </p>

<p>Foxconn has exploited labour laws and loopholes to employ workers for lower wages and longer hours. By maintaining tight work regimes for its workers, Foxconn has ensured high volume production. This is demonstrated in Foxconn's overtime statistics, with overtimes in peak production being over 100 hours a month with little overtime pay. Workers are forced to work overtime as basic wages not enough for survival. This leads to fatigue among employees and lower employee satisfaction. However, Foxconn solely considers the profit it is able to acquire as a result of this management system.  Additionally, in this Chinese education system, vocational school students must complete 2 years of work experience before graduation. However, since they are only interns, they are not legally employed by a company. This excludes them from labour law protections, trade unions and insurance schemes. Foxconn forces these ``interns" to work overtime and for less pay, exploiting legal loopholes in the process. Education departments encourage vocational school students to intern at Foxconn, providing Foxconn with low-cost employment. Due to Foxconn's size, it brings economic growth to the regions its factories are located in. This is used as leverage against public investigations and reports into the company's labour exploitation. Foxconn's exploitation of workers has helped it reduce production costs, expand into newer regions and continue to innovate.</p>
<p>Given the importance of a favourable labour pool in its innovation, Foxconn has moved toward the West of China to seek lower wages and production costs. Since the implementation of the Go West policy, China has shifted 20% of its production to the West of China. As previously mentioned, this provided Foxconn with access to capital and better infrastructure, but also gave them access to lower wages and production costs. With monthly minimum wages being RMB 500 <em>(approximately USD 75 in 2021)</em> less in Western regions than Shenzhen, Foxconn was encouraged to shift production toward the West. Foxconn now employs over 120,000 workers in its Chengdu factory, over 192,000 in its Zhengzhou factory and as shown in Figure 2, has expanded into multiple other Western Chinese regions. This reduction in wages has helped Foxconn maintain lower production costs and continue innovating. </p>

<h2>Foxconn's Current State</h2>

<p>After growing by a factor of 100 from 1998 to 2011, Foxconn has recently faced a slump. This is exemplified in Foxconn's falling stock prices over the past 5 years (Figure 3). </p>

<div class="center">

	<p>Figure 3: Foxconn's Stock price over the past 5 years</p>
</div>

<p>The graph above shows the falling value of Foxconn's stock over the past 5 years. A large reason for this slump is the three major changes to the labour landscape in China. Foxconn depends heavily on high volumes of low-skilled, low-cost migrant labour to maintain low production costs. The first trend shows increasing wages for migrant labour in China with a 5% growth rate recently. This compounded with increasing average Chinese wages has negatively affected Foxconn despite its efforts to seek out lower-cost labour by shifting production toward the West. The second trend shows the drop in the growth of the total number of migrant workers in China, with growth rates falling from over 5.5% to just 0.64%. This represents a shortage of workers and is shown in an increasing ratio of demand to supply of workers. This has further led to a rise in migrant wages. The third trend is an ageing migrant labour pool. The average age has risen to 40.2 years from 38.3 years in the past 5 years and 35.5 years in the past 10 years. With a majority of Foxconn's work being physical, and with age affecting physical performance, the negative effects of an ageing labour force have had negative effects on Foxconn's productivity. With Foxconn being a labour-heavy company, the three labour trends have drastically slowed down Foxconn's exponential growth in recent years.</p>

<h2>Discussion and Conclusion</h2>
<p>Foxconn has played a pivotal role in low-cost, high-quality technological devices. From a company manufacturing TV knobs to the world's largest electronics manufacturer, the firm has faced exponential growth in the past 50 years. The firm has had to overcome challenges in recent times with rising labour costs stagnating its growth. Additionally, Foxconn's relationships with Original Equipment Manufacturers <em>(OEMs)</em> have led to thinning operating margins, reducing the company's profits. Along with the Go West policy and rising wages, this has been a key reason for Foxconn's shift to the West of China to seek out low-cost labour. This has also promoted the automation of parts of Foxconn's production line and could be seen as the spark for a new age of Foxconn's growth. Since its founding in 1974, Foxconn has been aided by its geographic access to key business networks and knowledge spillovers, favourable Chinese state policies, and an advantageous labour pool. These factors have helped Foxconn become one of the world's most innovative manufacturing firms. </p>
